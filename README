Current Version is 1.1

==ABOUT==

I wrote this tool for monks.de to manage speak times of participants of medical (or any other) conferences. 

==INSTALLATION==

1) Make sure you have Java installed on your OS.
2) To install you just have to compile the tool with your favorite Java IDE. So compile and take the jar file out of the dist folder and put it some place convenient for you or run directly from that folder.

==RUN==

On any Platform type in:
"java -jar speechtimer.jar"

On Windows 7 you can just doubleclick speechtimer.jar

==TROUBLESHOOTING==

This tool was tested on RedHat/Fedora FC15 Linux with a 2.8 Kernel and on Microsoft Windows 7 with JDK 1.6.
I am not responsible for problems that result from the usage of this program.
