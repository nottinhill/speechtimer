Current Version is 1.0

==ABOUT==

I wrote this tool for monks.de to manage speak times of participants of medical (or any other) conferences. 

==INSTALLATION==

1) Make sure you have Java installed on your OS.
2) To install you just have to compile the tool with your favorite Java IDE. So compile and take the jar file out of the dist folder and put it some place convenient for you or run directly from that folder.

==RUN==

Run with
"java -jar speechtimer.jar"

==TROUBLESHOOTING==

This tool was tested on RedHat/Fedora FC15 Linux with a 2.8 Kernel and on Microsoft Windows 7 with JDK 1.6.
I am not responsible for problems that result from the usage of this program.

==CHANGES IN THIS VERSION ==

- Implemented dynamic Timings via UI, for single or all speakers
- Fix of last item persistence in speaker arraylist
- Add and remove Speaker via Gui
- Error handling and user feedback
- Hide or Show Clock to not intimidate speakers

Upcoming in Version 1.1
- Better looking Interace
- Sound Feedback
