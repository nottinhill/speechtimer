Current Version is 0.9

==ABOUT==

I wrote this tool for monks.de to manage speak times of participants of medical (or any other) conferences. 

==INSTALLATION==

1) Make sure you have Java installed on your OS.
2) To install you just have to compile the tool as I will not provide a build for well known security reasons. So compile and take the jar file out of the dist folder and put it some place convenient for you or run directly from that folder.

==RUN==

Run with
"java -jar speechtimer.jar"

==TROUBLESHOOTING==

This tool was tested on RedHat/Fedora FC15  Linux with a 2.8 Kernel.
I am not responsible for problems that result from the usage of this program (although you should be fine).
