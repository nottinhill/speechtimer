Current Version is beta 0.1

==ABOUT==

I wrote this tool for monks.de to manage speak times of participants of medical (or any other) conferences.

In the final release it should be possible to load speakers from a txt list.

==INSTALLATION==

1) Make sure you have Java installed on your OS.
2) To install you just have to compile the tool as I will not provide a build for well known security reasons. So compile and take the jar file out of the dist folder and put it some place convenient for you.

==RUN==

Run with
"java -jar speechtimer.jar"
